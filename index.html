    <h2>The party scene in 90s Toronto was serious(syrous?) and was magic for many. Some say the hay day for rap and hip hop music and many will agree. That time was also legendary for the rave scene in Toronto. The parties were incredible. You would know
        if you were a regular who experienced to ever gather at nathan Philips waiting for a shuttle bus to the mystery location or pounded the warehouse floor of the party promised land, the Hullabaloo and Shenanigans. This page is a nostalgic trip through
        some of the visual art and graphics of the parties and I hope it brings back some vibes. Its when the dawn comes and the sun shines on the party people...Hold tight toronto massiveâ€¦</h2>
